# Ticket Category Settings
# ================================
# Define different categories of tickets here.
# Each category should have a unique identifier.
# Note: The Discord limit is 25 select menu options, but it's not advisable to use that many.
# Each type consumes 2 categories, and Discord's maximum is 50. 
# Using too many types could exhaust your category options for regular Discord channels.
